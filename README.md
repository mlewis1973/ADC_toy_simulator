Mount Sinai collaboration

1) Install
https://www.anaconda.com/download
2) Download notebook
3) Run Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda Navigator and open notebook.
4) Shift-enter to evaluate cells
5) Current noise level sigma = 1.0 makes background ADC estimate incorrect, but vials are ok. Setting sigma=0.0001 is simulating a noise-free acquisition.
